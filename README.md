## Challenge  
*Which challenge have you decided to compete for?*

**SDV Lab Challenge**

## Core Idea  
*What is your rough solution idea?*

We are building a system to achieve perfect encirclement of criminal vehicles. Our solution enables multiple police vehicles to cooperatively surround and apprehend target vehicles through coordinated tracking and optimal path planning.

# 2. How Do You Work

## Development Process  
*Brief overview of your development process.*

Our team is divided into three specialized groups:

**Chase Vehicle Team** - Implementing police vehicles that lock-on to criminal vehicles and pursue them relentlessly until encirclement is achieved
- DongMin Jang, MinHyeok Choi
  
**Response Vehicle Team** - Implementing police vehicles that receive lock-on signals and dispatch to the criminal vehicle's location via optimal routes
- JaeHong Lim, JeongMin Jo
  
**Infrastructure & Integration Team** - Implementing workload orchestration using Ankaios, backbone network configuration, web interface development, and overall coordination
- Juhun Kang

### Planning & Tracking  
*How do you plan and track progress?*

**Each team develops and tests their code locally using CARLA 0.9.15. Once implementation and debugging are complete, we integrate all nodes together for system-wide testing.**

### Quality Assurance  
*How do you ensure quality (e.g., testing, documentation, code reviews)?*

1. Testing

- Unit testing per team
- Integration testing
- Latency measurement for each component

2. Documentation

- README documentation
- User guide

3. Code Reviews

- Cross-team code reviews during integration
- Continuous feedback and iteration

## Communication  
*How does your team communicate?*

**We communicate face-to-face in our workspace, enabling rapid problem-solving and real-time collaboration. Additionally, we use messaging platforms for asynchronous updates and documentation sharing.**

## Decision Making  
*How are decisions made in your team?*

Approach 1: Team leader proposes ideas → Team members provide feedback → Implementation and testing

Approach 2: Team members propose ideas → Team leader and other members review → Implementation and testing

We maintain a collaborative decision-making process where all voices are heard, and decisions are validated through actual implementation and testing results.
